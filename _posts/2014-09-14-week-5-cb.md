Dev Bootcamp is not just about technical coding knowledge.  The other aspects of being a successful developer are given equal weight.  We've been doing pair programming challenges everyweek, and giving each other feedback on what worked and what didn't.

Pair programming has been a very positive experience. Even though we're all learning, it's useful to explain things to others to drive your own understanding as well as have things shown to you.  And it might be more satisfying after solving a particularly knotty problem to have done so together.

Another part of this process is giving and receiving feedback about pairing sessions.  It's great to hear what worked well, but it might be more beneficial to hear what didn't.  The flip side, since we're giving as well as receiving feedback, is that it can be harder to give criticism than praise but it can be more valuable to know how to improve.

This comes down to trust.  The environment has to be right for this to work, and thus far I've gotten good experience and feedback out of working with others to solve problems and learn.
