Asking Questions?
Eventually you'll find something that you don't know and you can't find the answer to, so you'll have to ask a question.  If on stackoverflow, it is important to see if the question has been answered since you might get flamed pretty hard for asking something again.  But this shouldn't be discouragement from asking good questions.  It's important to make the title concise and the tags correct.  Then in the body of the question, it's best to give concise context as well as specific examples, usually code.  Anything you can do to make the question more specific will make the answer more relevant.  And ask questions! Otherwise, you might never know the answers.
