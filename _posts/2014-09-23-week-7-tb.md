Having spent considerable time in my previous job working with city records in databases of varying levels of sophistication, I am excited to get better at bending databases to my will.  I can think of one MS Access database that had snowballed over a decade to the point where it took minutes to return a query.  On the other hand, there were things run by Oracle that were well indexed and could return queries from an exponentially larger dataset in seconds.
I'm more excited by the possibilities of SQL, but if it's not necessary then naturally it makes sense to use NOSql options like MongoDB
In terms of optimization, many of the broader principles of other areas of CS apply.  Don't make the computer think harder than it has to -- don't use "HAVING" unless you've already filterd the DB.  Don't ask for more than you need to -- don't use SELECT * to return everything (and think about it) when you don't need all columns or enumerate each column to save processing time.
And having learned the lesson of Bobby Tables, I'm eager to learn more about sanitizing my data inputs.
