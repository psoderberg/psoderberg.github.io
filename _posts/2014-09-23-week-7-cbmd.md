Exploring Values
Personal Development can be immensely satisying while being incredibly beneficial.  Looking back over everything I've learned over the last month and a half in Phase 0 gives me a strong sense of accomplishment.  And I know that the hard technical skills I've learned as well as the more nuanced skill will continue to serve me well.

Values can often be seen as lofty ideals, but they are the cornerstones of what many people believe and how they live their lives.  I tend to see things as more nuanced, where everything belongs on a spectrum of moderation.  I find that zealotry can creep in if ephemeral notions are followed too literally.
