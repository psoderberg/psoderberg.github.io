Javascript : Pros and Cons

First, JavaScript is extraordinarily popular, so if there are a few cons to using JS, there must be reasons for its popularity. According to W3techs, around 90% of websites have used JS for years and continue to do so. There must be something to it.

Because JavaScript is run on the client side (using the user's computer as opposed to the server) this can speed up the user experience while reducing the load on the server. It is relatively simple: everything is an object. Also, it's popular enough so there is a huge community of users, with all the network effects this carries. And this network doesn't stop at JS: there is a wide array of frameworks that rely on JS.

These lead to some of its cons: because it is client-side, it can behave somewhat differently in different environments, and this also engenders some security risks. Because it is simple, it isn't the best choice for certain tasks. But there are still myriad reasons for ~90% of the worlds top 100K websites to use it in some capacity.
