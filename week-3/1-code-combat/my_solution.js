Codecombat 3.1
"this" refers to the owner of the function.  The owner would be the object that a function is a method of.  It works like a pronoun, so you don't have to keep reusing a proper name.

Parentheses feature in order of operations as well as if expressions.  They also hold the parameters that are passed to a function, or, empty, signify a lack of parameters.

Besides keeping stackoverflow arguing for years, semicolons in JS serve to separate statements.


This was a fun introduction to JavaScript.  My girlfriend could not believe how dorky the premise was.  I couldn't entirely disagree, but I still found it useful. I found pseudocoding this challenge tedious. The code was simple enough (one of the plusses of JS) that it was legible to humans and computers.  It took me a little bit to get curious about the use of "This"--a fine introduction to that concept.
