# U1.W3: Eloquent JavaScript


## Learning Competencies
- Compare Ruby and JavaScript Syntax
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create objects of different types in JavaScript

## Summary
This book comes highly recommended by our staff, so we're asking you to read through it and answer some questions before starting the next challenges.

For each release, read the appropriate chapter and answer the questions in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file. If you are less into writing, you can always record a video to include rather than text. It's up to you!

Read the chapter summary.



## Release 5: Evaluate Code Combat
Now that you know a little bit about JavaScript, go to the Taunt the Guards challenge on [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/play/level/taunt-the-guards) and answer the questions in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js)file.

You can choose whether to complete the actual challenge or not.

Now you should be ready to face the next challenges!

If you want to continue reading this book, we have no problem with that. You can even work through the exercises, but this is the end of what you will need for this week. Work to get a basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before you go deeper into the book.
