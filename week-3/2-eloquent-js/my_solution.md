U1.W3: Eloquent JavaScript

I worked on this challenge by myself.

##Release 0: Introduction

- Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?

- What do you still feel uncomfortable with?

## Release 1: Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

- Identify 2 similarities and 2 differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithematic, strings, booleans, and various operators you noticed.


## Release 2: Chapter 2: Program Structure

- What is an expression?

- What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?

- What is the cause of a variable returning "undefined?"

- Write your own variable and do something to it:

```javascript

// Write your variable and expression here

```

- What does console.log do and when would you use it?

- Write a program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. If they input a string, say: "Hey! That's my favorite too!" If they put something other than a string, return "I wouldn't eat that."
 (Test it out in the browser console. Node does not support the `prompt` function).

```javascript

// Your program here

```

- Describe `while` and `for` loops

- Did you notice any other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript in this section?

- Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, or Chess Board below)

```javascript

// Your code here

```

## Release 3: Functions

- Compare local and global variables

- When should you use functions?

- What is a function declaration?

- Complete the minimum exercise.

```javascript

// your code here

```



## Release 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

- What is the difference between using a dot and bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs. array[max]

- Create an object called "me" that stores your name, age, 3 favorite foods, and a quirk below.

```javascript

// Your object here

```

- What object in Ruby is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to?

## Release 5: Evaluate Code Combat

- Hover over `this` in the planning/spell section. Think programming-wise rather than in terms of the game.

- What kind of JavaScript thing are the spells? (don't list them out)

- What does `say` need in order to be invoked? Write an example of calling the say method.

```javascript

// your fancy say invokation here

```

## Release 6: Reflection
Write your reflection here.
