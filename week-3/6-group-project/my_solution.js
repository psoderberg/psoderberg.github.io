/* Reflection
Our group quickly did a merger with another group so we'd have enough people.  Then each person/pair quickly got their job done, so we didn't have any problems getting this done, even with larger team spread around the world.
Since Richard is in Europe, I rushed out of work and he stayed up a little late to make the scheduling work, but everything went smoothly.
Our task was to turn the pseudocode into code.  Perhaps the pseudocode could have broken things down a little more, although when you're dealing with math functions its pretty explicit.
The first one was a bit of a struggle.  We found a for loop for a syntax model, and did a little research on the interwebs to bring it together.  It was a good feeling to finally get that first one, and the syntax of the rest followed easily from there.
This was good, because the math got a little trickier, such finding where in the index you are while adding an if else branch.
I was glad Richard was a little stronger on the syntax at first, which helped us put together a model to repeat as the challenge got a little trickier.
