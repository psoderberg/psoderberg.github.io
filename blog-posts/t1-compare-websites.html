    <p> Three websites I'm on every day:

    <div class="main">
    <p> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.703236,-74.00786,3a,75y,354.31h,66.53t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1soOqzbdY-5vqhtiRuh3f4Bw!2e0">Google Street View</a>  I love the wealth of information that can be gleaned from this resource. And not just because I'm on it.  It's an incredible ongoing effort to gather the world's data, and with historical images, you can see how places changed over time.  You can take a drive anywhere and even go some places you can't drive.  Check out the Frick Museum.  Or see if a local bar is up to snuff.

    <div class="main">
    <p> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>  When you can tailor the news you see to tell you what you want to hear, having a newspaper of record becomes more important.  The layout might not feel as good as newsprint in your hands, but it feels almost as familiar, and there's no need to skip the second half of an article if you don't feel like turning to that page.

    <div class="main">
    <p> <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>
    Although I haven't been dabbling on GitHub for long, I've lived there this weekend.  There's a bit of a learning curve, but once you figure it out it becomes invaluable. And, crucially, octocat is adorable.
