# U1.W1: Beginning HTML

## Learning Competencies
- Set up a basic HTML page with the appropriate tags (html, head, title,etc.)
- Add paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, and/or tables
- Divide content on a page using divs and spans

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be building an html-only clone of [Berkshire Hathaway's website](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). It's a pretty simple site, but can be done in various ways.

If you want to pair on this, we recommend going through Release 0 and 1 prior to pairing. Then get together with your pair for releases 2 and 3.

## Releases

## Release 0: Clone your fork
In the last challenge, you cloned your [USERNAME].github.io site to your personal computer. In this challenge, you'll be doing most of your work in the phase-0-unit-1 repository.

Open this directory in sublime. Navigate to this file, and start reading the readme file (in Markdown) and making changes in the sublime files. Do not make changes, or even bother reading the curriculum, on github. It's good to get used to the way markdown looks (except to view images).


## Release 1: Learn Basic HTML

- Go through [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) sections:
  - HTML Basics
  - HTML Basics II (Sections 1-6 Only. Skip the styling sections.)
  - HTML Basics III


## Release 2: Set up your HTML Page
It's time to use the tools you learned in codecademy. In the [my-berkshire-site.html](my-berkshire-site.html), set up your webpage using the appropriate tags. You should have a doctype, html tags, a head, title, body, etc. Don't forget your closing tags!


## Release 3:
Now it's time to add the "fun" stuff. You don't need to point to the correct URL in the links; instead you can point to a placeholder (like`"#"`), but you should try getting the content to look about the same as the image below.

Consider whether you want to use a table or divs. [This article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/08/from-table-hell-to-div-hell/) to determine which you'd rather use.

You don't need to worry about formatting the site since you will be adding it in the [7-beginning-CSS](../7-beginning-CSS) challenge. When you finish adding the content using HTML, you site should look something like this:

![unformatted berkshire](../imgs/unformatted-berkshire.png)

We've included the Geico image (geicoimg.gif) for you in the week-1 [imgs](imgs) directory in for you to use in your site.

## Release 4: Reflect
Now edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge.

## Release 5: Publish
Commit your changes for each file in this challenge, and push your changes to github. Then double check your changes are on your www.github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0-unit-1 repository. You should see your commit message(s) there.
