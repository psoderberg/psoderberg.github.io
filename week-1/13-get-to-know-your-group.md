# U1.W1: Get to know your group

## Learning Competencies
- Describe what you learned from someone else's reflections
- Consider strategies for time management and productivity

## Summary

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  It's important to get used to sharing with each other.


## Release 0: Intro Email

Send your accountability group an email with the following information:

- Name
- Location
- Why you're attending DBC
- Your Favorite websites
- When the best time for you to pair is


## Release 1: Share your work
**DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU HAVE ISSUES ENABLED AS A FEATURE ON BOTH OF YOUR REPOSITORIES**

Once you've completed the week's work, send them:
- link to your forked `phase-0-unit-1` repository
- link to your [USERNAME].github.io site

Once you receive someone's repository link, take a moment to review your accountability member's reflections in their various challenges. Then leave feedback for them using the instructions on ["How to Create an Issue"](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md).
