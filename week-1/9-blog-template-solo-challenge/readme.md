# U1.W1: Blog Template SOLO CHALLENGE

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 1.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/) for more details as to what this entails.

## Learning Competencies
- Use a wireframe to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be building a blog template using the wireframe you make in the [8-wireframing](../8-wireframing) challenge. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site.

## Releases

## Release 0: Wireframe to HTML

First, navigate to your [USERNAME].github.io site in your terminal. Create a new directory called "blog-posts." In the blog-posts folder, create a new file called "blog-template.html."

Using the wireframe you created in the last challenge as a reference, build your blog template by creating HTML tags for specific content. You may want to add junk text to the template temporarily to test your CSS.

Once you have all of the content on your site, you are ready to add CSS.


## Release 1: Apply CSS

In the main directory for your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a "stylesheets" directory. In that directory, create a "blog-stylesheet.css" Link to that stylesheet in your blog-template.html.

Use CSS to position and format the content of your blog. Once you have it displayed as you want it, move on to the next release.

## Release 2: Delete unnecessary text

Since this is a template, you don't want to have unnecessary text you'll have to delete each time, so delete any of the temporary text. If you want to add comments like ```<!-- insert title here -->``` to make it clear what information goes where, that might be useful.

## Release 2: Commit your changes

Now that you've made your template, you're ready to use it in the blog assignments. Add your changes to the stage and commit them.

## Release 3: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

Get ready to blog!
