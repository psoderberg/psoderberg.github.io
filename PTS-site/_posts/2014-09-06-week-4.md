Some thoughts on `Enumerable#map`

`Enumerable#map` is a synonym for Enumberable#collect. Both of these methods perform an operation on each element in the enumerable. This method runs a block on each element in the array or enumerable on which it was called.

Here are some examples from the Pickaxe("Programming Ruby") (1..4).map {|i| i*i } # => [1, 4, 9, 16] (1..4).map { "cat" } # => ["cat", "cat", "cat", "cat"] (1..4).map(&:even?) # => [false, true, false, true]
