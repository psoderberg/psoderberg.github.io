We've been spending a lot of time working with classes in Ruby.  And with classes it makes sense to dive into instance variable.  The simple code block below illustrates how instance variables and methods work within a class.

{% highlight ruby %}
class TrafficLight

  attr_reader :car_motion
  attr_reader :my_car

    def initialize(my_car)
      @my_car=my_car
      @car_motion="approaching the light."
      puts "Your #{my_car} is #{car_motion}"
    end

    def red_light
       @car_motion="stopping."
      puts "Your #{my_car} is #{car_motion}"
    end

    def green_light
      @car_motion="going."
      puts "Your #{my_car} is #{car_motion}"
    end

    def yellow_light
      @car_motion="using caution/flooring it!"
      puts "Your #{my_car} is #{car_motion}"
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

This class makes it pretty simple to understand what's going on in it.  When an instance of the class is created with my car, the instance variables are created.  This lets them be accessed by other methods within the class.
So, when we call the #green_light method, it knows what 'my_car' is  because it's within its scope.

{% highlight ruby %}
car=TrafficLight.new("Ford")
puts car.red_light
{% endhighlight %}

And this returns:
{% highlight ruby%}
Your Ford is approaching the light.
Your Ford is stopping.
{% endhighlight %}
