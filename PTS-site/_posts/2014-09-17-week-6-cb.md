Stereotype Threat
This was defined by scholars Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in a widely-cited 1995 paper as "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristics, a negative stereotype about one's group."  This paper went on to show that the presence of this threat could undermine performance of tasks by members of stereotyped groups, even when the tests weren't measuring abilities.

A later artice by Steele holds that "virtually all aspects of underperformance—lower standardized-test scores, lower college grades, lower graduation rates—persist among students from the African-American middle class."

It follows that something besides class is holding people back.  So what can be done?

Steele discribes a minimilist "living and learning" community that aimed to overcome this threat.  A group of college students in a dorm were involved in a curriculum focused on academic strategies as well as personal discussions.  Moreover, this program produced results.

This could show that simply ackowledging something like stereotype threat diminishes its pernicious power.  Engaging with it can be enough to ameliorate its effects.

The small scale of some programs shows that even if broader societal opinions change slowly, it is increasingly likely that smaller cohesive communities can overcome challenges together.
