What is Rails?
Since I’ll be spending a lot of time with Rails in the near future I thought it made sense for me to get acquainted with Ruby on Rails.  Affectionately called, Rails, it is a wep application development framework.  A framework allows a programmer to build web applications without essentially reinventing the wheel every time.  Rails, like other frameworks, inlcludes conventions and templates that allow more complex things to be developed in a given time period than might be possible without them.</p>

<p>One of its strengths is RubyGems, which allows external
or shared packages to be installed to extend the capabilities that Ruby on Rails ships with. This can prove to be an issue at huge scales, since this doesn’t permit the same performance that some other options offer.  Even so, many household names that began as Rails sites have migrated backend work to more efficient frameworks while keeping the ruby front end.</p>
