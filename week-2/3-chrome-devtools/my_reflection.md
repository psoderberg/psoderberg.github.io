# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The DOM describes how elements in a webpage (the document) fit together.  Each element is a node, and they form a tree that is the structure of the page.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

My page took a quarter second.  Tuts's wordpress
crashed PageSpeed.  They have a lot more going on, but I want my page to do more.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

The interface is a little cramped.  Makes me want a second monitor to pop it out of the window.  But I got better at knowing what tab etc. I wanted to be in, as well as using find or inspecting the webpage itself to go directly to the resource I wanted.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I liked the question about changing the color of the text on the image of machina. I had a hunch that was the case, but then I could go right to the source and figure it out.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
