# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think industry-wide standards are a force for good.  Thankfully, the USB standard proved popular enough that phone chargers are finally getting standardized, which is great for a consumer.  Before, each manufacturer had one or several proprietary incompatible formats. A similar phenomenon would happen in other areas, including the web, without standards.  Let everyone compete, but not to the detriment of the market.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

Yes, it makes sense that an industry-wide group along with an independent group should promote shared standards that facilitate compatibility.  It's fiendishly difficult to get billions of devices working more or less the same way, so changes will be slow, but without improvements the standards would fail.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I'm not sure yet.  I think they make sense in some applications.  It's harder when you're updating someone else's page.

* Why is reset.css necessary?

Many browsers configure things slightly differently.  reset or doctor is necessary to make content display uniformly across platforms.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I use mainly Chrome, but also use Opera on my phone (for compression if I have a weak signal).  At work we have some databases that require IE(for activeX) or Mozilla.  And then there's Tor, which looks bare-bones compared to all the rest, but that's the point.  The looks aren't that important, but it's frustrating when functionality gets compromised, especially with sites that don't have the resources to test everything.
