# U1.W2: Thinking about Time

## Learning Competencies
- Research time management and productivity
- Explain "Time Boxing" and describe how to use it

## Summary
Remote learning is challenging, especially if you prefer to learn with others. In this challenge you will do some research on time management, productivity, and mindfulness so you can design a plan for your learning during Phase 0. 

Read/watch a few of the articles below, until you find something that interests you. Once you do, search for more resources on the subject/technique, and browse whatever you find. 
Try to push yourself to read outside your comfort zone. Expand your awareness of strategies for time management and productivity. Can you apply any of what you come across to your situation?

## Release 0: Research 
Research Time Management, Productivity, and Mindfulness using the following (or other) resources as your starting point. 'Sprawl' by searching for more resources related to the below. 
Cover as much ground as quickly as you can, getting an idea of the borders around the subject without charting every square inch. You want to understand the scope of this challenge before 
you dig into a particular sub-set.
