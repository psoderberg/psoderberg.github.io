# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* How do you manage your time currently?
I tend to set off large blocks of time if I want to accomplish something important.
* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
That's not always possible, and even when it is, sometimes tasks take longer than they ought to since I feel like I can take as much time as I want.  This can lead to diving too deep into a tangential topic, or working slowly until I realize a deadline is looming, then rushing ahead.
* What techniques did you look into during this challenge that interested you?
I like the "start micro (2 minutes)" in 7 counterproductive ways.
* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I want to be better about doing a little bit every day.  I often work well when I can set off a large block of time to get things done, but that's not always possible.  It certainly shouldn't be the several hours right before assignments are due.  Also, more learning can be absorbed with constant progress as opposed to a stressful marathon.
