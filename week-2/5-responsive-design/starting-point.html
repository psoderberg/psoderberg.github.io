    <p>This is the site that Kevin and I teamed up on to make a little responsive.  We were both learning as we went.  There were a few stumbling blocks, and a few times we should have taken a step back to think about how we should make a change rather than continue with guess-and-check, but overall it was a positive experience.  It's a little tricky to figure out what someone else's stylesheet is doing.  Maybe I'm too naive to notice a trick, but there was a "side-b" placeholder that didn't seem to do anything.  We found it was important to actually do the math when it comes to converting pixels to percentages.  Ballparking just didn't cut it.
