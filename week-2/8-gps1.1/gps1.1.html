  <section> <h4> What is pair programming? </h4>
      <p>Pair programming is collaborating on a project between two developers in real time.  It typically involves a driver and a navigator to divide the responsibilities.</p>

      <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
      <p>Not only does pair programming assist with better learning, it also prepares us for real world programming.</p>

      <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator.</h4>
      <p>The driver is responsible for performing all the actions regarding the project, while the navigator is responsible for directing and overseeing the driver's actions.</p>

      <h4>What was it like to pair for the first time? Did you enjoy it? What worked? What didn't work?</h4>

      <p>We enjoyed this pairing session.  Dividing the roles into driving and navigating worked well.  We switched roles half-way and continued to be successful.  Stypi didn't work, but we overcame that glitch by using screenshare.  At first, our header wouldn't stay at the top.  After a little trial and error, we found the key to success by using CSS instead of HTML.
