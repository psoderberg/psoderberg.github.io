# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: [Place your website link here]()

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?

These are slightly different but related concepts, and they can work together to produce successful sites.  Design has to do more with the look of a page, while UX describes how someone visiting the site gets around it.  Good design can improve UX--if things are layed out clearly, it promotes a better experience.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I do like thinking about design and UX.  I tried to keep my wireframing simple, with an eye to what I could actually put together in a few hours.  This made building out the site more successful, but it was still a little arduous.  I suspect I'll learn techniques that enable me to make changes more quickly, rather than editing too many HTML files.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I got a trial version of Adobe Illustrator to make my wireframes.  The free web tools were fine, but I wanted more control and have always loved CS. And this allowed me to whip up a little logo, which of course could use improvements (thanks, timeboxing, for letting me sleep a little).
On the HTML side, I copied my index file to make the about, projects, and blog pages.  I suspect there's a better way, since I ended up making small changes several times in all 4 files. Right now there's 1 stylesheet for all 4 pages.  This might work, but it might not.  We'll see.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

My site feels a little sparse.  I like a clean look, but it could use some more visual interest.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

I still struggle a little moving things around the page.  It's becoming more natural, though.

* What else do you want to build, make a list to check back on later!

I want to make it responsive. I need to make it adjust to smaller screens.

I need to get rid of the absolute positioning, especially in the content portion. This isn't working.  It was a fine kludge at first, but it needs to go.

I like the fixed position on the left side and top nav, but they need background.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
